# Cache

This service is based on the new caching service in ILIA 9 and offers almost 
exactly the same public API, so it will be much easier to switch to the new 
service in an ILIAS 9 version of the plugin.

The documentation of the service can be found here: [ILIAS Cache](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/tree/release_9/src/Cache/README.md)
